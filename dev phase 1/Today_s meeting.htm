<DIV>Hi Karen,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It was a pleasure to chat with you today - and thanks again for the 
flowers.&nbsp; As I&nbsp;write I've just caught a whiff of their beautiful 
fragrance.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As per our dissussion, I'd like your co. to develop an idea we've been 
noodling here at CBC&nbsp;to refresh the broadcast of archival programs by 
creating a virtual gaming component. Specifically, we'd like you to work with 
five half-hour programs to be selected from the CBC Vancouver archives and using 
them, develop a concept for an interactive game that requires the participants 
to watch the broadcasts for at least some of the clues.</DIV>
<DIV>Ideally, the concept will involve the actual city of Vancouver in some way 
- although we need to be mindful of the fact that the broadcast signal extends 
far beyond Vancouver and we do not want those viewers to be excluded. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The proposal is to see if we can&nbsp;use this concept to celebrate our 
50th anniversary which will mean the broadcasts begin in mid- November.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>We're looking for an approach that is&nbsp;low-cost but effective here - 
and that, of course, will be one of the first theories to test. Can&nbsp;the 
game be created&nbsp;in an affordable and timely manner&nbsp;if the broadcast 
component is already provided?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The development phase should include:</DIV>
<DIV>-selection of the archival programs</DIV>
<DIV>-dev't of the gaming concept including a&nbsp;comprehensive treatment of 
the elements required to execute.</DIV>
<DIV>-budget</DIV>
<DIV>-production timeline</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>For the initial development, it would be preferable if you did not bring 
potential third parties such as the city economic dev't dep't into the mix as 
we'd like to assess the idea before raising any expectations.&nbsp; However, 
feel free to brainstorm as to how other partners might be involved.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Unfortunately, our business manager is away on annual leave at the moment 
so a contract will be a little delayed.&nbsp; Would you like to submit a 
development budget, and move forward that way - or simply have us state a 
figure?&nbsp; If it's the latter, some idea of the time involved to complete the 
development phase would be helpful.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I am cc'ing a couple of people on this note - Geoff Wong is manager of 
partnerships and although we're not involving any external organizations at this 
stage, he might well be involved in the future — also Ken Golemba, Senior 
Manager Television Production Services who will bring our businees manager up to 
speed when she returns.&nbsp; </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Unfortunately our archivist Colin Preston is also away but we hope to be 
able to brief him early next week at the latest.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Although this is not a deluxe model virtual gaming proposal, I hope the 
opportunity allows your company to exercise some of your gaming expertise.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>If you have questions based on the above, just let me know.&nbsp; Look 
forward to hearing from you.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Regards,</DIV>
<DIV>Rae</DIV></BODY></HTML>
